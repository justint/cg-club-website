### Project Ole Red

3D VR Environment Project at SJSU to visualize redwood tree air processing on Mars. The project is working in tandem with multiple projects in association with HP Mars Home Planet initiative. The project is designed to work autonomously as well as potentially collaborate with the challenge projects.

Project Ole Red is looking for 3d Modelers and Programmers willing to learn to work in VR and UE4.

### Facial Motion Capture System

Stringless is a real-time, markerless, single-camera facial motion capture system. By using dlib facial landmark detection, Stringless captures facial motion data as a collection of data points and sends it to an Autodesk Maya plug-in, where a user can map the motion capture data to a rigged face model. It was originally built as a pseudo-thesis project at SJSU, but is now a continual work in progress with updates and added features.

For an overview of the system's design, operation flow, and current issues, please see [this presentation](http://justintennant.me/Stringless_NASA_Presentation.pdf), which was given live at the NASA Ames Research Center in June 2017.
