This is the club’s first meeting with officers and members after it became official by SJSU Associated Students. Justin Tennant, our club president, introduced the purpose of the club and brief explanation on computer graphics. Club officers introduced themselves, and members briefly introduced their major and year. Then, Justin discussed future plans. Members, who attended, were entered in a raffle for a Google cardboard.
