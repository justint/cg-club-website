Our club's own advisor, Professor Robert Bruce, will be giving an introductory talk on OpenCV, a widely adapted, free, and open-source computer vision library! Those with an interest in augmented reality (AR) or computer vision are highly recommended to attend.

This talk is the beginning of our "Intro to ____" series, in which the club brings in experts on voted topics to give talks and presentations to a beginner or non-technical audience. Those with experience are still invited to come and possibly learn on details not known before.
