The Computer Graphics Club is a student organization at San JosÃ© State University, in San Jose, CA. Formed out of a need to represent students with an interest in computer graphics, the CG Club aims to be an asset to student life by connecting the SJSU community to the CG industry.

# Goals
The Computer Graphics Club at SJSU focuses on three goals:

> 1. Expanding awareness & presence of computer graphics technology on campus.
> 2. Uniting and sparking collaboration between the design, digital art, engineering, and science departments.
> 3. Connecting students to the companies, software, events, and technology of the computer graphics industry.

This spring 2017 semester, our goals are to:

> 1. Build and identify a community among the club
> 2. Send students to the [SIGGRAPH 2017 conference](http://s2017.siggraph.org/)
